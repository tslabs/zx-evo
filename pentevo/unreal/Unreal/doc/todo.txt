Tests:
- check TheLink Turbo switching for Pentagon config

Bugs:
- Incorrect exit from DEBUG in Bomber (paging?)
- Probably incorrect DOS on/off behaviour with regard to RAM at #0000 (MEMCONFIG)
- 3x and 4x renderers on Win7 crash Unreal

Missing features:
- ld a,r and ld a,i tacts not recalculated for Turbo (op_ed.cpp.177 and op_ed.cpp.232)
- leds
- ATM3 wrong palette update in Personal Nightmare demo due to fine ATM3 port decode (PN uses coarse addressing)
- NoFlic (in some renderers)
- VDOS
- other clones full compatibility
- TheLink doesn't compile on TSconf (probably missing #EFF7 features)

To Do:
- Save settings to .ini
- Carry out Debugger into separate window
- Add all models resources to Debugger
- Save .avi using VFW
- Add some workaround for TR-DOS timeouts on 7+ Turbo
- Separate reset() and res_init() procedures
- Add res_init() to SNA load when TS-conf active

X-factors:
- Regular lags/glitches in when Process Explorer ON
