        Pentagon 128/512/1024 and 48K ROM
        Scorpion 256/1024 RAM and 64K ROM
        Scorpion PROF-ROM with SMUC support (128/256/512K)
        KAY-256/1024 and 64K ROM
        Profi 1024 RAM/ROM and memory mapper
        ATM TURBO 1 v4.50 512/1024 RAM, 64-1024K ROM
        ATM TURBO 2+ v7.10 128/512/1024 RAM, 64-1024K ROM
        cache 16/32K
        CMOS/RTC: russian chip (512Bu1, 64 bytes, 1st day is monday) or
          pc-compatible (DALLAS, 256 bytes, 1st day of week is sunday)
        SMUC RTC and NVRAM (24LC16)

  sound

        beeper, tape saving and loading tones

        AY-3-8910/YM2149: excellent sound emulation, including digital
        and unusual effects, parallel ports on R14/R15 are not emulated

        Turbo-AY (Turbo-Sound): two AY(or YM) chips by PoS and NedoPC schemes

        TurboSound FM: two YM2203 chips (6 AY channels + 6 FM channels)

        also there is 'unreal' (not available in real Spectrum) mode:
        playing AY music using digital player - emul plays three sound samples
        with volumes and frequencies taken from corresponding AY registers
        and 'pseudo-turbo' - two parallel YM chips with some phase shift

        two covoxes - Pentagon (port #FB) & Scorpion (port #DD)

        SounDrive

        saving sound to WAV or VTX (VTX - good format for AY sound, much
        more compact than PSG, but you need lha.exe somewhere in %PATH%)

        General Sound - FX & MOD player through BASS sound system.
        You can save music and listen it in your favourite mod-player

        General Sound low level emulation (including internal Z80 on 12MHz,
        512Kb onboard memory, internal ports and DACs)

        BASS offers higher quality and more sound channels than low-level
        emulation. Low-level emulation is useful for programs altering the
        firmware player and using second Z80 for their own needs. In general,
        use BASS for games, and low-level emulation for advanced sound/music
        editors (RIFF tracker)

  video

        several video drivers, from simple and fastest to complex bi-linear
        filtering, that upsamples Spectrum display to 512x384 * 64 colors;
        'noflic' filter is specially for programs fast switching two screens
        to get more colors;
        several chunky filters for 21st century demos

        amazing video filter: Anti-Text64. Designed for reading e-zines.
        It converts 4x8 fonts to 8x8 or 8x16 on the fly and saves your eyes

        multicolors are fixed for Pentagon & Scorpion, 1T screen update
        for all border effects

        able to emulate scorpion timings, including scorpion border update

        nopaper mode for debugging border effects

        flash-color (using 128 ink colors with black paper when FLASH bit on)

        hi-res modes: Pentagon 512x192, Profi 512x240, ATM
        (works with 'double' video filter)

        ATM-TURBO color video modes (works with 'double' video filter):
        text mode 80x25, EGA mode 320x200, 640x200.
        To use custom text-mode font, place your "SGEN.ROM" to unreal directory.
        Don't use border=none with ATM video modes

        Pentagon 384x304 mode [see ZX-Guide#2, AlCoNews#32]

        Pentagon color-per-pixel mode [see Info Guide#8, #9]

        hardware multicolor

        attribute port #FF


  tune-up video/sound with hotkeys

        change video settings, such as number of t-states/frame, t-states/line,
        fix with grey+, grey-, grey*

        t-states/frame is a computer speed, so it's easy to adjust speed in
        fast (or slow) games in very wide range for comfortable playing

        alt+grey*, grey-, grey+ selects soundchip (AY/YM) and
        stereo mode (ABC/ACB), or palette


  beta 128 disk interface

        implemented all FDC WD1793 commands, including read/format track

        traps for read/write sector - more then 256 times speedup


  tape

        full TAP and TZX support

        CSW support

        tape browser

        auto-start tape when accessing to ROM load routine

        fast loading: UnrealSpeccy is able to recognize loader logic
           and speed up loader by removing delay loops and edge detection loops.
           (Of course, UnrealSpeccy leaves original t-states timing,
           so max speed mode must be enabled for fast loading - press NumLock)
           With this technique any 128K game may be loaded in 10-20 secs.
           I've developed this feature independent from RAMSOFT, but looks like
           they used the same idea in RS 0.90.38...
           For really fast loading, also choose 'normal' video driver


  IDE

        UnrealSpeccy is able to use KAY, SCORPION and ATM-2 IDE interfaces with
        two devices on it (hard disks or CD-ROMs)

        for hard disks you may use image file or Spectrum drive, connected to
        computer. CD-ROM requires physical or windows-level emulated device

        schemes supported:
        Nemo - controller for ZX-BUS manufactured by Nemo and NedoPC
        ATM - ATM TURBO 2+ v7.10
        Nemo(A8) - Nemo scheme modification: uses A8 instead of A0 to
                   select high/low byte of 16bit data (easy to
                   transfer sector with just two commands INIR:INIR)
        SMUC - IDE controller for ZS Scorpion

  modem

        ISA modem, configured to use COM1 ports 03F8-03FF
        translated to Spectrum's ports #F8EF-#FFEF.
        Modem interrupt (translated to Spectrum NMI) is not emulated
        Host computer should have installed windows driver for real modem.
        At least ping/dns by Kamil Karimov tested and works fine
        with empty 'modem initialization string'


  input devices

        fully customizable keyboard
        copy text from clipboard via emulation of Spectrum keyboard
        AY-mouse (KORVET mouse, connected to AY-3-8910/12 port A)
        kempston mouse with adjustable speed and swap-buttons option,
        mouse wheel included (D7..D4 in buttons' port or UP/DOWN keys)
        kempston joystick on keyboard
        kempston joystick on mouse (joystick will follow mouse cursor)
        mouse wheel and buttons can be bound to any zx keys or kempston
        PC joystick/gamepad can be bound to any zx keys or kempston
        sticky keys mode [stolen from ZX_Emul, read description there]
        autofire (with adjustable key and period)

  files

        reading:

           SP, SNA and Z80 (all versions, 48k and 128k)
           TAP, TZX, CSW
           FDI, TRD, SCL, TD0, UDI
                  if disk image does not contain boot.B, it may be appended.
                  Disk images for every drive may be loaded automatically
                  at start of UnrealSpeccy
           HOBETA format - appends file to existing disk; if no disk, then empty
                  TR-DOS disk will be created. Best use with command line:
                  unreal.exe prog.$B prog.$C   <- will be placed on same disk
                  You can also load it from 'F3' dialog, but only by one file

        writing:

           SNA 48k and 128k
           TRD, FDI, UDI
           TD0  (saved unpacked, so expect saved file larger than loaded)
           SCR, BMP (screenshots)
           WAV, VTX


        disk images converter:

           emulator can open disk image in any format (TRD/TD0/FDI/SCL/UDI)
           and save it to any other format


  leds

        1. AY volume/status. Just for fun. White color - tone, yellow - noise,
           green - envelope; also shows YM2203 and GS volumes

        2. perfomance leds. One displays how much Z80 t-states is between two
           interrupts. While watching some demo you can see how much time
           takes one or another effect. Second led shows PC framerate - at
           normal speed it must be 50. If it is less, then your CPU is too
           slow, and sound may be jerky - try to select faster video driver,
           disable some devices, increase skipframe or decrease t-states
           per int. When running on max speed, framerate shows how fast you
           computer is. For example, 800 fps is 16 times faster than
           Spectrum, so average game will load in 20 secs.

        3. input led. Shows which input devices are active - keyboard, mouse,
           kempston joystick. For keyboard, displays queried keyrows.
           One example: I've noticed, that in KOL0BOK2 intro active keyrows
           are <B>-<SPACE> and A-G. <SPACE> is an exit, but why program
           scans <A>-<G> ? I've pressed <A>, and I saw that now program
           queries <Y>-<P>. After pressing A+P, program queries <CAPS>-<V>.
           When pressing A+P+X active keyrow areonly <B>-<SPACE>. So, I've
           found cheat without digging in program code! (Another way was to
           set breakpoint on reading port #FE and analyze code nearby)

        4. loading led. When saving/loading from disk, emulator shows
           blue or red diskette. When formatting track, yellow disk is
           displayed. When loading from tape, emulator displays
           cassette picture and progress for current block (or 'PS' - tape
           silence)

        5. local time - for those ZX Spectrum fans, who spend all their
           time with virtual Spectrum

        6. on-screen watches - display used RAM and ROM banks in last frame,
           count user-defined expressions

        7. using leds on AT keyboard to display AY amplitude peaks


        leds look strange when flash-color is enabled. It's not a bug


  monitor

        software that in PC world is called 'debugger', in Spectrum world
        is often called 'monitor'

        find text or code.
        Using mask: code matches when ((code & mask) == (pattern & mask))

        unlimited number of code breakpoints

        conditional breakpoints of any complexity, uses C-like expression
        syntax (with this feature can be easily done: breakpoint on range,
        breakpoint to port in and out, on instruction, etc..)

        memory access breakpoints (on reading/writing/executing of given memory
        areas)

        built-in Z80 assembler/disassembler

        save-load memory blocks

        disk editor

        ripper's tool: for ripping routines with their data.
        Marks which bytes were read/written, and saves whole 64kb memory,
        replacing unreferenced bytes with user-defined byte (default is #CF)

        hotkeys to save/restore cursor position in disasm window

        hotkeys for location instruction operand in Z80 or dump window

        on-screen watches: show memory areas addressed by register pairs


  GUI

        all settings, that present in INI file, may be changed in GUI
        (but will not be saved, for permanent effect edit INI file)

        easy entering POKEs, if you don't want to use monitor or use
        HEX addresses. Delimiters for numbers are space, comma, colon,
        semicolon - so POKEs can be cut'n'pasted from any cheats collection

        loading from archives. Now supported: CAB,ZIP,RAR.
        You can add your own archivers to INI file

----------------------------------------------------------------------

system requirements

        Windows 95 or higher, or NT (not tested).
        Windows 2000/XP/2003 are required for real HDD support.

        for running UnrealSpeccy you need:

            Pentium-166 CPU MMX for basic functionality
            Celeron-266 CPU for Profi/Pentagon/ATM/Anti-Text64 hi-res modes
            Celeron-400 CPU for GS low-level emulation
            UnrealSpeccy eats only 12Mb of RAM, so
             if you've started Windows, then memory is enough
            2D accelerared video card with hardware support of
             video overlays and color keying for overlay modes
            3D accelerared video card for hardware chunky bilinear filter
            2 Mb of video memory in fullscreen
            4 Mb of video memory for windowed mode
            16-bit sound card [optional, but recommended]


        if you have such hardware, but emulator runs slow, try the
        following:

            0. install latest directX and videocard drivers
            1. increase sound buffer size (especially for Win95) in INI file
            2. select video filter='small', video driver='ddraw'
            3. disable vsync
            4. set 'ShareCPU=0' in INI file
            5. do not use General Sound low-level emulation
            6. do not use YM2203
            7. set 'skipframe=4' in INI file
            8. set 'Frame=30000' in INI file (if nothing else does not work)
            9. disable sound (without sound emulator runs much faster)

        this should help

Alt-C           breakpoints manager
Alt-Y           switch active sound chip in Turbo-Sound mode


       manager can handle 3 types of breakpoints:

       1. conditional breakpoints and on-screen watches
       are using C expression syntax.

       operators (in priority order):
         () ! ~ M(x) -> * % / + - >> << > < == = <= >= != & ^ | && ||
       operands:
         a,b,c,d,e,h,l,bc,de,hl                 - common registers
         a',b',c',d',e',h',l',bc',de',hl'       - alternative registers
         ix,iy,pc,sp,i,r                        - control registers
         FD     - memory port #FD (also known as #7FFD)
         OUT    - port used in 'OUT' command (or 0FFFFFFFF when no outs)
         IN     - port used in 'IN'  command (or 0FFFFFFFF when no ins)
         VAL    - read/written value to port (only meaningful when OUT != 
0FFFFFFFF or IN != 0FFFFFFFF)
         numbers - hex, must start with digit: DFFD - wrong, 0DFFD - right
         characters - must be enclosed in single quotes ('A','B',etc..)
       All calculations use 32-bit unsigned interger arithmetic.
       If you are not familiar with C, use brackets as much as possible, due to
       non-intuitive operator's precedence, e.g.
       out & 0FF == 0FE   is treated as 'out & (0FF == 0FE)' <- always 0

       M(x) is byte from memory address x (same as x->0)
       '=' is an alias for '==' (for Pascal programmers)

       examples:

           (out+1) | (in+1)       - in/out to any port
           (in & 8001) == 0       - read keyboard row from <B> to <SPACE>
           !(out & 1)             - any out to port #FE
           (out & 0FF)==0BB && (val==0F3 || val==0F4) - reset General Sound
           (out & 0FF)==0FD && (val&7)==3   - set 3rd memory page
           (FD & 7) == 3                    - the same
           M(pc)==0CB && pc->1 >= 10 && pc->1 <= 17
                - set break on executing instruction "rl <reg>"

       I hope, these examples will be enough to get idea

       note: double-click on breakpoint to edit it

       2. execution breakpoints (also set in CPU window by pressing SPACE).
          In manager window it is easy to setup breakpoint on execution
          range like 6000-FFFF

       3. breakpoints on reading/writing memory. Similar to execution
          breakpoints, but have flags "R" and "W" to issue interrupt on
          reading/writing memory address (flags may be set together)

bugs and incompatibilities


   some programs, such as Manic Miner and Lode Runner, require
   old 48K ROM (1982.rom), while some other programs require
   ZX Spectrum 128 ROM (48for128.rom + 128tr!.rom)

   some TR-DOS programs (Unreal Megademo by KSA, Street Fighter)
   work only if TR-DOS traps are disabled and all delays enabled

   Profi service ROM can work only when all TR-DOS delays are enabled

   Bumpy does not work in default configuration, it tries to read port
   #FFDF for kempston joystick - so disable kempston mouse before
   playing [bug found by Paul Pavlov]

   sounddrv=wave does not work with CTSB128PCI (Creative Sound Blaster),
   there is a bug in drivers for this card. [bug found by Nuts]

   some ABS adventures (ALIEN.SCL, LENIN.SCL) do not work with TR-DOS 5.04TM,
   use version 5.03 - it is most compatible [bug found by Paul Pavlov]

   Vixen 1,2,3 - incompatible with SounDrive [bug found by Paul Pavlov]
   Fernandez - incompatible with SounDrive [bug found by Shadow Maker]

   port #FF sometimes is not responding when SkipFrame!=0
   (the same to SkipFrameMaxSpeed!=0 and max speed mode)

   Scorpion 'MAGIC' generates NMI even if PC < #4000, but shadow
   monitor is not designed for this situation and may crash

   CacheVox by AlCo requires TR-DOS delays enabled and [BETA128] IL=1

   If the emulator after returning of focus seems to have a sticky key,
   press Scroll Lock, deactivate blinking key, then press Scroll Lock again.

   If emulator control keys work wrong after returning of focus, press Enter,
   and keys must go normal.
   
   If emulator hangs with General Sound, try DSPrimary=0.

   If emulator crashes with General Sound, try GSType=Z80.
   
   If Kempston Joystick doesn't work, go to menu, press NumLock there,
then return.

   In case of bad sound, try DSPrimary=1 (may crash emulator eventually!)
or SoundDrv=wave in .ini.

   Screenshots are saved to the emulator directory.
   Files to read and write via debugger are situated in a current directory
(which is seen by F3).
